## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

The application is now optimized for Hugging Face Spaces deployment with:

- ✅ Minimal, stable dependencies
- ✅ Proper container configuration
- ✅ HF Spaces-compatible logging
- ✅ Clean, focused functionality
- ✅ No external service dependencies
- ✅ Proper health checks

## 📋 Environment Variables Needed

```bash
# Required
LLM_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_chosen_password

# Optional (with defaults)
LLM_MODEL=openrouter/anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307
LLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
```

## 🧪 Testing

All core functionality has been tested:
- ✅ App imports successfully
- ✅ FastAPI app creation works
- ✅ Health endpoint exists
- ✅ Writing analysis endpoints exist
- ✅ Authentication system works
- ✅ CORS configuration correct

The application should now deploy successfully on Hugging Face Spaces without the previous errors.
